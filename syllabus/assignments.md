# Assessed Work

Assessment will be in five categories:
- Reading Questions & Class participation: 10%
- Lab/Homework assignments:  35%
- Mid-term Exam: 25%
- Class Project: 30% 
  - Dashboard:  20%
  - Presentation: 10%


## Reading Questions

Students will be expected to read assignments before class on the days indicated, so they will be prepared to participate in class discussions and to make progress on a lab assignment during class.  All students should submit at least one question per week connecting to the week’s readings via TopHat by 8am Eastern Time on the day of class that the reading is to be completed by.  Reading assignments and due dates will appear in the course’s calendar in Canvas.  There is a link to the course TopHat site inside the Canvas webpage. Submitting your questions well before class starts is important, so the instructor will have time to read the questions and update the day’s lesson to respond to student questions.  You’re also encouraged to take a look at questions submitted by other students and give a “thumbs up” to indicate those questions that you’d like to be addressed in class.  Since reading questions can not be made up, each student’s six lowest reading question scores will be dropped when computing final grades.  Students who are reluctant to ask questions in class are especially encouraged to ask extra questions prior to class.  

## Class Participation

While attendance and participation in class is important to the class and your learning, it is more important that we all stay safe and healthy.  All students must follow all COVID protocols required by the university.  In particular, any student who does not feel well or who could transmit COVID must not attend class in Davey Lab.  If you are in isolation or quarantine, then you can still earn credit for reading questions and class participation by: submitting reading questions prior to a Monday or Friday class and engaging in Wednesday classes via Zoom.  

In-class computing lab sessions will provide an opportunity to work on lab/homework assignments in small groups.  Gaining experience communicating technical information and working as a team is an important part of the course, so students should participate regularly.  Attendance will be taken during Wednesday lab sessions.  If the student is not online when attendance is taken, then they will not earn a point for that week’s class participation (even if they arrive later or were participating previously that day).  If you know you need to miss class due to research travel or health issues, then let the instructor know in advance whenever practical.  In some cases, it may be possible to watch a recording of missed classes. If that is not practical for whatever reason, then students should make plans to get a classmate’s notes for any missed class sessions.


## Lab/Homework Assignments

Students will often have a chance to begin work on a computer lab/homework assignment in small groups (via Zoom breakout rooms) during the Wednesday class session.  Homework exercises will typically be due before the start of class on Monday.  Any deviations from this schedule will be announced via Canvas.  If the University is closed on the due date of an assignment (due to bad weather or any other reason), then the assignment will be due by 9am before the next class session (that is not canceled).  There will be a 10% penalty on assignments submitted after the deadline and up to one week after deadline, and a 20% penalty on assignments submitted more than one week and up to two weeks after the deadline, and a 30% penalty on assignments submitted more than 2 weeks after the deadline.    


## Mid-Term Examination Policy
 
A midterm exam will be taken in our regular classroom during our regular class time.  It is closed book and closed notes.  The only two conditions under which you can request a makeup exam: (1) If you know in advance that you will have to miss a midterm exam for a university sponsored trip (e.g., athletics, research field work, class field trip) or religious observance, then you must request a makeup midterm in advance of the exam and as early in the semester as possible, to facilitate scheduling. Documentation will be required.  (2) If you are injured or ill or in isolation or quarantine during the midterm exam, you should request a makeup exam as soon as practical and no later than one week after the midterm. Medical documentation may be requested. Please email the instructor as soon as you are able to request scheduling a makeup exam. The format of a makeup midterm exam will be at the instructor's discretion. Possible formats include (but are not limited to) short answer, essay, or oral exam.


## Class Project

Students will synthesize lessons learned in the class by building an exoplanet “dashboard” that ingests data related to detecting and/or characterizing exoplanets, performs basic data manipulations, fits a model to the data, assesses the quality of the model for the given observations, and effectively visualizes the results.  More detailed instructions will be provided after the mid-term  This is a substantive project and students should spread their effort over several weeks of the semester.  Students are encouraged to work in small teams of two to three, so that they can build a high-quality dashboard.  Groups will submit a single dashboard and present their dashboard to the full class during the final week of class as a group.  Each student will submit a statement describing their contributions to the dashboard project, describing the contributions of their teammates, and reflecting on what they learned from the experience.  Remember that both you and other group members will have other assignments, exams, and projects.  Therefore, it is very important to develop a mutually agreeable schedule and to follow through on your contributions in a timely fashion.
