# Expected Student Preparation

This class assumes that students have knowledge of mechanics and astronomical methods and experience with basic programming concepts (e.g., data types, arrays, functions, loops and conditional statements), but not with numerical methods or statistical theory.   
Homework/lab assignments will make use of the Julia programming language, but no prior experience with Julia is expected.  
During the first half of the semester, examples or starter code will be provided so that students can focus on concepts rather than implementation details.  
During the second half of the semester, students will (in small teams) create a dashboard for analyzing and visualizing data from one exoplanet survey.  
This will require synthesizing lessons on exoplanet detection techniques with Data Science skills built throughout the semester.  

## Prerequisites
Formally, the prerequisites for the class are:
- ( Astro 291 OR (ASTRO 401 AND ASTRO 402W) ) AND 
- ( CMPSC 121 OR CMPSC 131 OR CMPSC 201 ) AND 
- ( MATH 230 OR MATH 231) AND 
- ( PHYS 211 )
Any student who is interested in the class and has not completed the above, should consult with the instructor before starting the class.  

## Relation to Other Courses
Data Science represents the synthesis of knowledge and skills from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and an application domain, as well several supporting skills (e.g., workflows, visualization, data ethics, communications, teamwork). Even students majoring in Data Sciences will not take classes covering all the important Data Science topics! This class is designed to complement ASTRO 410, 415 and 451 (and classes beyond the Astronomy department, e.g. MATH 220 and DS 310), so as to provide astronomy majors an introduction to data science skills that are particularly relevant to astronomical research and can be readily applied to other disciplines.

Since this class does not presume ASTRO 410, 415 or 451 as a prerequisite, there will be some modest overlap (i.e., essentials to fit a model to data).  While ASTRO 451 provides a broad overview of astronomical  techniques, this class will go into more detail about methods for detecting and characterizing exoplanets.  While ASTRO 415 will provide a more rigorous treatment of statistical foundations, this class will emphasize applying such techniques and developing a broader set of data science skills.  While ASTRO 410 will teach students how to implement numerical methods common in astrophysics research, this class will apply numerical methods that have already been implemented for students.  The instructor will point out connections to other courses where students could learn more about a topic.
