# Astro 497: Data Science Applications to Exoplanets  

## Course Overview
Students will learn about techniques for detecting and characterizing extrasolar planetary systems, including the capabilities and challenges for the future of each method.  Students will analyze astronomical data to detect and characterize exoplanets and their host stars.  Along the way, students will build practical data science skills (e.g., querying astronomical databases, data storage and manipulation, data visualization, exploratory and explanatory data analysis, Bayesian modeling workflows, and reproducible research practices).
